psh allows you to spawn new processes in the Unix shell-style way.

Unix shell is very convenient for spawning processes, connecting them into
pipes, etc, but it has a very limited language which is often not suitable for
writing complex programs. Python is a very flexible and reach language which is
used in a wide variety of application domains, but its standard subprocess
module is very limited. psh combines the power of Python language and an
elegant shell-style way to execute processes.
